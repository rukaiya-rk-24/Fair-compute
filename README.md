# Fair-compute

This tool provides a user-friendly interface for DocuBot an AI Medical Advisor. It allows users to upload images and get prescriptions from AI . The application leverages the power of LLaVA, a large multimodal model, to analyze visual and textual input, offering rich insights and responses. This interface is particularly useful for educational purposes, research, and development, enabling quick and easy interaction with the model.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images directly from their device for analysis.
Text Prompts: Alongside image uploads, users can input text prompts asking for desired responses from the model for a combined or standalone textual analysis.
Webcam Support: The tool supports capturing images directly via the user's webcam, enhancing its versatility.
Asynchronous Processing: Utilizes asynchronous calls to efficiently handle requests and responses to and from the LLaVA model API.
Harness the power of the Fair Compute Llava endpoint, which boasts a cutting-edge multimodal model akin to the futuristic GPT-4.
