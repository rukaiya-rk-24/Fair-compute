# Fair-compute

This tool provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the LLaVA model API, allowing users to upload images and enter text prompts. The application leverages the power of LLaVA, a large multimodal model, to analyze visual and textual input, offering rich insights and responses. This interface is particularly useful for educational purposes, research, and development, enabling quick and easy interaction with the model.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images directly from their device for analysis.
Text Prompts: Alongside image uploads, users can input text prompts asking for desired responses from the model for a combined or standalone textual analysis.
Webcam Support: The tool supports capturing images directly via the user's webcam, enhancing its versatility.
Asynchronous Processing: Utilizes asynchronous calls to efficiently handle requests and responses to and from the LLaVA model API.
